# Car Resale Price Prediction ML Model!

This is my **first ML model** that I coded!  

I used **Scikit-learn** in Python to create two predictive **Regression** models using **K-Nearest Neighbors** and **Random Forest** algorithms. I also **learned** Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for comprehensive data **cleaning**, **analysis**, and **visualization** to gain insights and for informed model development. In addition, I applied **GridSearch** for **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize the performance of the ML models.

Please check out the Project's **Kaggle** **Notebook**! : [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pandu0/car-resale-price-prediction-scikit-learn)

You can also down the [Jupyter Notebook](./car-resale-price-prediction.ipynb) or the [code](./ml-model.py)!

[Dataset](./car_web_scraped_dataset.csv) was obtained from Kaggle as well.
